# Matches an hledger `include` directive line.
#
# Purpose: detect whether a non-indented line is an include directive and
#          extract the target path string for further resolution.
#
# Group breakdown:
#   (1) (.+)  — the raw target path string, captured after the mandatory
#               whitespace that follows the "include" keyword. May contain
#               glob characters, tildes, slashes, or spaces. Caller strips
#               leading/trailing whitespace before use.
#
# Edge cases:
#   - A line of just "include" (no whitespace) does not match because \s+
#     requires at least one whitespace character after the keyword.
#   - "include  " (keyword + only spaces) matches with a whitespace-only
#     group (1); the caller raises ParseError after stripping.
#   - Indented lines (starting with spaces/tabs) do not match because ^
#     anchors to the start of the line; indented posting-style lines are
#     never directives.
#   - "included" or "includes" do not match because \s+ requires whitespace
#     immediately after the exact word "include".
